To setup and run the benchmark/performance tests please follow these steps:

--I am using MySQL so you can install MySQL and the MySQL Adapter or go ahead and use another by modifying the db.yml file
  
  1) Create a database named 'sequel_performer' (this can also be changed in config/db.yml)
  2) Create the parties and people tables
    PARTIES:
      :id       int11 PK  auto_increment
      :theme    char(255)   NOT NULL
    PEOPLE:
      :id          int(11) PK auto_increment 
      :party_id    int(11) FK NOT NULL
      :name        char(255)                  
      :address     char(255)                 
  3) Make sure you have a user named root with no password or modify the config/db.yml file as needed to match a user in your db
  4) Verify you have all the dependencies installed (They are listed in dependencies.rb)
  5) Go ahead and cd into the root of the app and execute the runner file to begin testing
     ruby runner.rb

NOTE: 
  This is pretty bare bones and not too in depth.  It was all I needed to complete my task at the time     
  Please let me know if anything is missing concerning these steps; tim.linquist@gmail.com
