To use this, you first need to copy db.yml.example to db.yml, and modify it
accordingly.

Then you can run the benchmarking via:

  ruby simple_orm_benchmark -o sequel -n 1000

or:

  ruby simple_orm_benchmark -o active_record -n 1000

Options:

* -o is the ORM to use (sequel and active_record currently supported)
* -n is the number of objects to test with (1000 by default)
  
Thanks to tim.linquist@gmail.com (timo3377) for sequel-benchmark and
activerecord-benchmark, on which simple_orm_benchmark is based.

script.
